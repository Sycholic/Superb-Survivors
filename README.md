  This is an unofficial upkeep of the mod Superb Survivors! which is or was known as SSR.
  
  Link to the mod on steam in the description section which also links the wiki to the parent repo.
And based on owner's seems to be SSR's official continuation.  The official mod on steam is several versions
ahead of the source this is forked from.   Which is why this fork was created to try and bring the source up to date.

  Claim no rights to any of the original source used and if the parent repo gets updated
it is more then welcome to use any changes.  Will not likely issue any pull requests due how much differences there are between the file/folder layout of the parent repo and the mod.

  *Note: this github page is NOT the complete mod it is only the source code in \media\lua\ *
  
  Install the original mod. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1905148104
  
  Go to where this mod installed and copy the folder called "Superb-Survivors" located in the workshop\content\108600\1905148104\mods folder.  Open the folder for PZ in your home directory called Zomboid\mods and paste a copy of the original mod here, rename it to something else and then open that folder.  Edit the mod.info file and change the "name=Superb Surivors" to something else. Eg. name=Superb Survivors 4178  This gives you an identifable local copy of the mod (and this way you do not change the original mod)

  Install/download this fork into a UNIQUE location.  Copy the client, server, shared folders to where you created the copy of the original mod into the media\lua folder.  Ignore the .git folder (if you can see it) and README.md file they are not part of the mod just part of git.  

  *Remember this is not official nor the whole mod this only the lua source code.*
  
  *If a new version of the mod is released on steam this will not change anything you do, only the original mod will get updated not your local copy/modified version*
  
  *This is 'use at your own risk' and only was created to offer bugfixes back to the original authors but anyone is more then welcome to use and test these changes.*
