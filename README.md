  This is an unofficial upkeep of the mod Superb Survivors! which is or was known as SSR.
  
  Link to the mod on steam in the about section which also links the wiki to the parent repo.
And based on owner's seems to be SSR's official continuation.  The official mod on steam is several versions
ahead of the source this is forked from.
  
  Which is why this fork was created to bring the source up to date.

  All files here are located in the media/lua directory of the mod.  Why it has not be kept in the
same layout as the mod itself is unknown.  Any bugs fixes and/or changes would have to
be applied manually for now (I dont see any way around this)

  Claim no rights to any of the original source used and if the parent repo gets updated
it is more then welcome to use any changes as that is why it was forked.  Will not likely issue any pull
requests due how much changes there are and possibly going to just update the fork to match the mod
completely except the one class file.

  If anything would like to see the original bring the whole repo to match and follow the mod layout.
Eg. missing folders, mod.info SurvivorOptions.lua files etc. Maybe the attack.class file source if possible?
