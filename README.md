  This is an unofficial upkeep of the mod Superb Survivors! which is or was known as SSR.
  
  Link to the mod on steam in the about section which also links the wiki to the parent repo.
And based on owner's seems to be SSR's official continuation.  The official mod on steam is several versions
ahead of the source this is forked from.
  
  Which is why this fork was created to bring the source up to date.

  All files here are located in the media/lua directory of the mod.  Why it has not be kept in the
same layout as the mod itself is unknown.  Any bugs fixes and/or changes would have to
be applied manually for now (I dont see any way around this)

  Claim no rights to any of the original source used and if the parent repo gets updated
it is more then welcome to use any changes as that is why it was forked.  Will not likely issue any pull
requests due how much changes there are and possibly going to just update the fork to match the mod
completely except the one class file.

  If anything would like to see the original bring the whole repo to match and follow the mod layout.
Eg. missing folders, mod.info SurvivorOptions.lua files etc. Maybe the attack.class file source if possible?

  Note: this github page is NOT the complete mod it is only the source code part in /media/lua

  If you wish to use the updates done here on this fork, you should know how to use git and github.

  Install the original mod. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1905148104

  Mod installs into your steam folder workshop\content\108600\ on the same drive where steam installed your game. You can verify this being right by finding common folder next to workshop and then see ProjectZomboid folder in there.

  Make a copy of this fork into a unique location which then gives you a copy of the <mod>\media\lua scripts then you can copy all three folders and scripts. Overwrite the folders and .lua scripts with updated ones.  Ignore the .git folder (if you can see it) and README.md file they are not part of the mod just part of git.

  *Remember this is not official nor the whole mod this only sources currently. It is just fixing bugs as they are found*
